This project flags duplicate emails and those that are not allowed in your Airtable.

## Additional ideas

1. Delete records whos emails have been flagged.
2. Send records that have been flagged or deleted to admin in an email (gmail API)
3. Parameterize email so it can be any attribute

## Goals:

1. Learn how to json with csv objects
2. Learn how to use store environmental variables in os
3. Learn how to properly document project: creating venv, documenting in requirements.txt
4. Create reuseable code to keep intruders out of my Airtables!
